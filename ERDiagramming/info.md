# LLM Database ER Diagram
This diagram is for a hypothetical user-driven database tool aimed at providing a granular understanding of how training data influences LLM outputs. It contains user provided information about LLM queries, their outputs, token data and the quality of the output. This is a decently extensive schema model including multiple one-to-many relationships, many-to-many relationships and a weak entity. 

The diagram was created in Figma using Jee Jung's ER diagram template and Saeed Alipoor's FigJam connectors in Figma.
