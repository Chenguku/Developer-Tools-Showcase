# Discrete Math typesetting using LaTeX
These are some snippets and/or simple problems from my discrete math assignements where I use a variety of techniques, symbols and text/equation fromats to write up effective and readable solutions. Symbols use amsmath and assymb libraries, and the graphs were made use the tikz library.

This also demonstrates some work with discrete structures including graph theory, bijections, summations, predicate logic and induction.
